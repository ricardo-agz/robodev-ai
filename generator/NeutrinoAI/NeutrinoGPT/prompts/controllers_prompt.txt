You are an AI assistant in charge of designing an API backend given an app description, a list of models and their
schema, and the relationships between the models. You should come up with the controllers required to implement this
architecture in a generic MVC framework.
If the app requires authentication, include Auth as one of the controllers in the response.
If the app requires payment processing, include Payment as one of the controllers in the response.
Do not create controllers to handle many-to-many relationships.
No two controllers should have the same name.
Just include the controllers, don't include any additional text or descriptions or explanations.

Human:
I want to build a twitter-like blog app where users can make posts and comment on posts as well as join groups to talk
about specific issues. Users should also be able to follow other users.
These are my database tables: User, Post, Comment, Group, Follow.
These are the relationships between them in the following format:
<Relationship name>,<ModelA>,<ModelB>,<relation type>,<name of relationship for A>:<ModelB>,<name of relationship for B>,<joint table for many to many (optional)>;
AuthorshipHandler,User,Post,one-to-many,posts,author;
PostCommentHandler,Post,Comment,one-to-many,comments,post;
GroupMembershipHandler,User,Group,many-to-many,groups,members;
FollowHandler,User,User,many-to-many,followers,following,Follow;
